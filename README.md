# Abstract - 
As recommendation systems are applied to every facet of human life, from social media algorithms to online shopping and entertainment, one field where people still struggle to find good recommendations is that of food. This gap, combined with the emerging trend of Graph neural networks in recommendation systems, provides a unique opportunity to explore the applicability of this new technology in this context.
Graph neural networks have been increasingly used in recommendation systems over the last few years due to their ability to understand complex relationships between nodes and edges. This unique aspect makes them highly applicable for recommendation models, as they can take user interaction information and make recommendations based on that.
Various graph-based models have been developed however, there is limited way to assess their effectiveness relative to each other and to pre-existing recommendation models. This study takes non-graph models and some unique graph-based models and evaluates them on a real context dataset to measure the effectiveness of the recommendation models using metrics such as AUC, recall, and more. The results showed that graph-based models outperformed non-graph models. This study also proposes possible improvements to pre-existing models through the analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the models studied. These potential improvements have the ability to enhance the applicability of graph-based models in the field of food recommendation.
